-   **ESLint with an emphasis on functional patterns (with Prettier and TypeScript integration)** to make your code look its best.
-   **React Axe and React A11y for accessibility** so that your site is awesome for everyone.

## Installation

You will need to have `node` and `npm` installed on your computer.

You can either use `npx` or install the `gatsby-cli` globally.

The `npx` way:

```sh
npx gatsby new kiit-hacktoberfest https://github.com/S-ayanide/gatsby-starter-typescript-seo-grand
```

or the global way:

```sh
npm i -g gatsby-cli
gatsby new kiit-hacktoberfest https://github.com/S-ayanide/gatsby-starter-typescript-seo-grand
```

## Usage

To start the development servers:

```sh
npm run develop
```

If all was successful, you should see links to two development servers in the Node terminal. You can open these url in any browser that you would like.

1. [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080):

This is the development server that allows you to preview your website. It comes with hot-module reloading, which means that you should see your changes almost immediately without having to refresh the browser tab.

2. [http://localhost:8000/\_\_\_graphql](http://localhost:8000/___graphql):

This is the development server that allows you to interact with the your site's GraphQL data via the GraphiQL IDE.
